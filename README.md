## Description
We have developed a DL model to provide automatic, accurate and fast chamber segmentation (Left ventricle and Left atrium) + cardiac imaging planes re-slicing (two-chamber, three-chamber, four-chamber planes + a short-axis stack) from cardiac CT images. 

The purpose of this GitHub repo is to use trained DL models to predict segmentation and planes on *new* CT cases.

This repo has two sets of scripts: **Main and Premier**.<br />
- **Main**: because the input of DL model has to be the under-sampled CT volumes (pixel_dim = 1.5mm), This set of script "Main" can return you the segmentations and planes in *low resolution*.<br />
    - You may have multiple trained models (trained on different dataset) acting like multiple human experts. Thus, the other important purpose of "Main" is to let you select which model gives you the adequate results.<br />
- **Premier**: turn the low resolution DL outputs into high resolution (pixel_dim = 0.625)
